# GaiaJ1027
simple analysis of 2MASS J10274572+0629104

Having matched West et al. (2011)'s list of spectroscopic M6-M9 dwarfs with Gaia DR2 in Vizier
and downloaded the results into a VOTable file, the iPython notebook makes a hess diagram 
with 2MASS J10274572+0629104 marked in red.

The paper is already submitted by Paudel et al. to MNRAS and the preprint is available at:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13026

This plot is being made to respond to the referee's comments. You can see that 2M1027 clearly
lies at the upper edge of the main sequence, as expected in our interpretation of it as both young
and a near-equal luminosity binary.
